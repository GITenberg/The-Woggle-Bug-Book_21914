description: The Woggle-Bug, a creation from the mind of L. Frank Baum, who also penned
  the Wizard of Oz series, captivated the United States in the early 1900s. The comical
  character was a multimedia sensation at the time, appearing in everything from comic
  strips to books to a live stage show. Though some of the ethnic humor in the book
  may be somewhat jarring to modern readers, The Woggle-Bug Book remains a captivating
  read more than 100 years after its initial release.
